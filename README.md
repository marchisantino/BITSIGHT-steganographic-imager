# BITSIGHT-steganographic-imager
BITSIGHT is a browser-based local tool for visualizing images at the bit level. It can reveal hidden information, highlight artifacts from image editing or AI generation (and other things), and even apply simple filters. I made this tool primarily for myself and used AI to help me code it. The code quality suffers, but it works.
